# Router module

The router module is made of two base methods, the `route` and `router`. We divide those two to ease extending their behaviour or simply to enable you to use your algorithm without having to sacrifice any parts of our code you want to use. Since AÃ§ai was built with the agnostic paradigm, you are able to use the router for both the backend and the frontend.

## Parts
### Route
Is the part that is responsible for building the available routes, their file paths and extra options. It allows you to easily group, and use. It's intention is not to actually do the match, but to only build the routes for usage or cache.

### Router
Is the part that is responsible for doing a match with a given path string and routes available.

## Examples
``` typescript
import { route, router } from "@acai/router";

// build routes
route("register", 	"controllers/register");
route("login", 		"controllers/login");
route("recover",	"controllers/recover");

// find active route
const options = router("login", await route.build());

console.log(options);
/**
 * Will print:
 * 
 * {
 *		path: "login",
 *		file: "controllers/login",
 * 		options: {}
 * }
 */
```
