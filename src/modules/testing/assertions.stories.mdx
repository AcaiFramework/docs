# Testing module assertions

You already have seen the base equal assertion you can do, but you can also do so much more than that, event concatenate assertion tests. We have a lot of assertions because even thou you can do almost everything with equals, we don't want you to format your assertion, so you can easily concatenate it.

## Types

### toEqual
Assert that the value passed is equal to the base assertion.

``` typescript
// assertion passes
expect(2 + 2).toEqual(4);

// assertion doesn't pass
expect(2 + 2).toEqual(5);
```

### toNotEqual
Opposite to equals, only passes if the value does'nt match the base assertion.

``` typescript
// assertion passes
expect(2 + 2).toNotEqual(5);

// assertion doesn't pass
expect(2 + 2).toNotEqual(4);
```

### toTypeOf
Assert that the base assertion is of the following type

``` typescript
// assertion passes
expect("hi").toTypeOf("string");

// assertion doesn't pass
expect("hi").toTypeOf("object");
```
