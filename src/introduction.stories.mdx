# Açai Framework

Açai framework aims to be a stack agnsotic framework intended to be used with deno, back or front-end. It aims for simplicity, it should be easy to understand, read and adapt/extend.

## Conventions
We use [APO Softworks default conventions](https://github.com/Aposoftworks-Convention-Sets), being those:

- [RUA](https://github.com/Aposoftworks-Convention-Sets/principle_rua)
- [Database naming](https://github.com/Aposoftworks-Convention-Sets/database_naming)
- [Hierarchy case](https://github.com/Aposoftworks-Convention-Sets/hierarchycase)
- [Table tab identantion](https://github.com/Aposoftworks-Convention-Sets/tabletab-ident)

## Why Açai?

- Açaí tastes wonderfully
- Açaí comes from Brazil
- Açaí has ç, which breaks most of systems, we want ç implemented!
- Açaí has no right way to eat, you can do however you want
- Did I say that açaí tastes wonderfully?

Since we love our brazilian nationality, we want to spread it to the world, every way possible. And one of the things that bothers us the most, is that our special characters are not allowed in many places throughout the internet, and we want that changed.
